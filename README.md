# Flood Susceptibility Forecasting using Machine Learning
This machine learning model utilizes Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Linear Regression, and Decision Tree models. It employs these four algorithms to capture various aspects of the data's relationship with flood risk.

Following the initial predictions from each model, the top two performers are then combined using an average ensemble method. This strategy takes the average of the two best model predictions for the final flood probability prediction.

This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of flood probability.
